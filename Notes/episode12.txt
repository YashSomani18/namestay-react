Learning Redux :-

Redux works with the DATA layer of the app
redux is not mandatory, we may not need redux
redux and react are different library
use redux wisely 
redux is not the only library -> zustand is another library
redux offer easy debugging

YES, it is okay to have all your data at one place in redux so you can access it from anywhere
also we divide it into slices so it doesnot get clumpsy

when we click the add button it dispatches(action)-> function -> then updates the cart 
we cannot directly update the cart

the function is known as "reducer"

Note:- when you hit the add button it dispatches an action which calls the reducer function which updates the slice of redux store

If we want to read data then we will use a selector that will give you data in the header and update cart
selector is called subscribe the store
we say so because if the data is updated in the cart it will automagically update the cart in header component
