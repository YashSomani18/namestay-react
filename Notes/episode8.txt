In this episode we are going to learn about class based components which is
an older technique to write code in react, till now we did "functional components"
which is way easier and newer way in th industry 

functional components-> function which returns some sort of jsx
class based components->class which has a render method which returns some jsx


we donnot update the state variable in class components directly.

first constructor and then render

api is called in componentDidMount in class based components
because:-
we can call api in functional components using useEffect but here we need this

constructor -> render -> componentDidMount

we call api in the componentDidMount because
we first want the react to render it and then make api call and then fill the data
it is better UX we have already learnt this before

React is faster because react has 2 phases
1) Render
2) COMMIT

As we know DOM manipulation is the costliest method we tend to do it later and less time
so we first batch the rendering all together and then update the UI in the commit phase

parent constructor
parent render
    first child constructor
    first child rendering

    second child constructor
    second child rendering


    <DOM UPDATED IN SINGLE BATCH>
    first child componentDidMount
    second child componentDidMount
parent componentDidMount

mounting is done in commit phase
hence calling API here is the best time

--- MOUNTING CYCLE ----
Constructor (dummy)
Rendering (dummy)
    <HTML Dummy></HTML>
componentDidMount
    <API CALL></API>
    <this.setstate> -> State variable is UPDATED

------UPDATE CYCLE -----
    Rendering(API DATA)
    <HTML new data></HTML>
    componentDidUpdate
