when we donnot use the useEffect with a dependency array
useEffect(()=>{

},"[]") here this array is not present then useEffect will be called each and every
time react re-renders the site

if the dependency array is empty, useEffect is called once for the first time

if we put something in the array then useEffect will be called only when
dependency in the array changes.


-Always call your useState inside your body component
-Always call the useState top of function.
-Never create your useState in your if else-> this can create inconsistency in your program
but it is okay for javascript it is not wrong code it is wrong practice
- Also Never create them in a for loop 


*********************************************************************
ROUTING:-

Using npm i react-router-dom for routing purpose

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout/>
  },
  {
    path:"/about",
    element
  }
]);

we give router the values
in which we pass the array and in array we pass the path  and element

to use createBrowserRouter we need another dependency from the react-router-dom
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
 which is router RouterProvider
 then we need to pass it like this

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);


{
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    errorElement:<Error/>
  },

  this way in it we can make our own customed error page

  also we can use inbuild HOOK called use "useRouteError"

  now we will import another import function from react-router-dom
  which is "Outlet"-> this helps us in children routing
  like if we want our header to be everywhere and other components
  to be replaced with the links
  we do it in children like this

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path:"/",
        element:<Body/>
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);


When you want to route to some other page in react do-not ever use anchor tag
because whole page is refreshed
in react you can navigate to a new page without reloading the whole page

for that purpose we will take "link" from react-router-dom

<li><Link to="/about">About Us</Link></li>

this helps to make your app very faster,
though it works similar to anchor tag but it doesnot re-renders the whole page
and hence it is faster 
<Link to="/about">About Us</Link>
<a href="/about">About</a>


------
Important 
there are 2 types of Routing:-
1) Client side routing-> When we first time load the app it already loads the about and contact page and then when we click on it, it shows it no network call has been made 
2) Server side routing-> we make a call to the server and then fetch the HTML(from server).
