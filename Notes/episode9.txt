learning to optimize the code 

learning how to make your own custom hook

1) Know what you want as input
2) Know what is your output


App chunking or Code splitting or Dynamic Bundling or Dynamic import or On Demand Loading

Here we know that for large application we need to divide the chunk in different files
we need to optimize our app as we know parcel and babel are beast
they will optimize your whole code in 1 javascript file and then do the Loading

but let say our app is very big like makemytrip
 and if we load all components together it will take time and we loose customers
 we dont want that obviously here comes the role of

 LAZY LOADING:-
import React, { lazy, Suspense} from "react";

firstly import these important files

now do not normally import the files like 
import Grocery from "./components/Grocery.js"

now import using lazy

const Grocery = lazy(() => {
  return import("./components/Grocery");
});
lazy() 
take a function/promise and return it
const Grocery = lazy(() =>  import("./components/Grocery"));

you can also do it like this, this is basic javascript

after doing so
now we will use Suspense


    {
        path: "/grocery",
        element: (
          <Suspense fallback={<h1>Hiiiii</h1>}>
            <Grocery />
          </Suspense>
        ),
      },
