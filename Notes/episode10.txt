Learning TAILWIND CSS :-

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init

we need to do This,visit tailwind site and see what framework you are using and accordingly
install it 

here we instal tailwindcss -> which we are going to use already 
postcss is -> a tool transforming css with javascript
we donnot need to learn postcss to learn tailwindcss,
so we just need to know tailwind uses postcss.

we make a .postcssrc file and we make plugins in it
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}

this is the way we tell parcel to find tailwind classes in our code,
and execute them

now we make changes in the tailwind.config.js file
by changing the format 
content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],

  this means in the src folder if you find any file with .{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}
  then apply tailwind css for this files

  now we need to delete all the code in our index.css and put
  
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

    into the index.css file and never write another css code in it
