Every Elemenet in the react is an object 

reactdom converts the react object into HTML which is then understood by 
the browser 

createElement tag uses 3 arguments, first is the HTML tag like <h1> , <p>
<div> etc , second takes the Attributes like if we give an id or any other thing
like that and third one is the children like having the content in it
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Hello by React js");

we can give third element which is children as another react element and createElement
nested loops and make them into one another

const parent = React.createElement("div",{id:"div"},
React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Hello by React js"));


Also if we want to give more than two things in the same div let say here we are giving
only 1 children as h1 tag and hellp by reactjs
if we want to give another children h2 tag as hello two from react
we then need to send a list i.e use square brackets as array

ex:-

const second = React.createElement("div",{id: "division"}, [
    React.createElement("h1",{id:"head1"},"Hello myself React"),
    React.createElement("h2",{id:"head2"},"Hello i am second react")
]);

root.render is replacing what so ever is already present in the given tag like we are placing it into
div whose id is root then The whole HTML in will be replaced,
rest other divs in the HTML will remain as it is
