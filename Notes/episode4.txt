first, make a planner and draw a basic structure of how you want your site to be 
and then proceed to make it

Planner for our Food delivering App:-
1) Header
    - LOGO
    - Nav items
2) Body 
    - Search
    - Restaurant container
        =Restaurant card
3) Footer
    - Copyright
    - Contact Us
    - Address
    - Links    



To give inline css in JSX then you make another javascript object and put css in it and then in 
you JSX code call style = {"name of the javascript object"}
like this =>    <div className="res-card" style = {styleCard}>
another way is =>        <h3 style={{padding:"10px"}}> Meghana Foods </h3>


------PROPS------

-props are just passing arguments to a javascript function
you can send any number of information from your calling and then it will be wrapped up as props
and you can call it "{props.resName}" You call javascript like this in JSX.

    CONFLICT DRIVEN UI:-
    let's understand this with an example that like Swiggy website shows different offers in different cities
    so they are not making different websites for different cities, 
    to plan this out and know your conflicts are called conflict-driven UI



=> This is the code till episode 4 now we are going to make changes in the code
so it will get lost as we push on the GitHub so we are maintaining the data in 
the notes file like .txt files  <=



  const RestaurantCard = (props) => {
  const { resName, cuisine, stars, time } = props;

  this is an ideal practice to use destructuring of javascript and use it effectively 
  and you send details like this :-
  <RestaurantCard
          resName="Meghana Foods"
          cuisine="Biryani, North Indian, Asian"
          stars="4.3 stars"
          time="30 Mins"
        />


ANOTHER WAY TO SEND DATA IS 
<RestaurantCard
    resData = {resObj}
    />

    you can make another javascript object and then store all the data in it and then pass it as 
    resObj in the react to make it easy and simpler

"?." this is optional chaining

so in your code now,
you can dynamically call the RestaurantCard by maping it using javascript

<div className="res-container">
    {
        resList.map((restaurant) => (
            <RestaurantCard key = {restaurant.data.id} resData = {restaurant}/>
        ))
    }
</div>

also remember whenever you are looping on to a map always give a keyto it, key is a reserved
key word 
react itself says that never use indexes as key. we can use it but it is not recommended
